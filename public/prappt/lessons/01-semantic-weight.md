## Why "manners" matter (technically)

In PrAPPt, language is not decoration—it is steering.

Large Language Models respond differently to "order" language vs "collaborate" language because words carry different semantic weight in the training distribution.

This is why the framework uses respectful, explicit phrasing like "The user understands that you are…" in [[03-construction-phase|Construction]].

## Tool mindset vs partner mindset

A "tool mindset" sounds like: "I command, you execute," which tends to yield generic, safe, lowest-common-denominator output.

An "AiBou mindset" treats the model as a constrained collaborator (without pretending it is human), which nudges the output toward a more professional, context-aware stance.

PrAPPt names this collaborator stance explicitly as [[AiBou]] and builds the rest of the script to support it.

## Practice: rewrite a prompt

Take a tool-mode prompt and convert it into partnership language.

Example pattern:
- Tool mode: "Write X."
- AiBou mode: "Partner with me to design X; ask me 1–2 clarifying questions first; then deliver in format Y."

## Connections

- Next: [[02-discovery-phase|Discovery Phase]] turns your raw intent into atomic deliverables.
- Later: [[03-construction-phase|Construction Phase]] encodes the partnership contract into a PrAPPt script.
