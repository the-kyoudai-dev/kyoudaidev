## The blank page problem

Most people fail at AiBou building because they start by trying to write a "perfect script" from nothing.

The Discovery Phase fixes this by separating **idea generation** from **structure**.

## Step 1 — Brain dump (stream of consciousness)

Write everything you want, without editing, focusing on what you want—not how to say it.

Use prompts like:
- What is this AiBou going to help with?
- What should the [[PRODUCT]] look like?
- What would make you happy to see?

## Step 2 — Proto-AiBou (atomic discovery)

Use a temporary, generic AI chat as a "Proto-AiBou" to organize the mess into deliverables.

Canonical Discovery Prompt (copy/paste):
> "Hello! May I ask you to turn this into a more concise description of the deliverables that an AI assistant could provide, please?: [PASTE YOUR STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE]"

## Step 3 — Review & revise (find the atomic PRODUCT)

From the deliverables list, identify the single, concrete [[PRODUCT]] in one sentence (e.g., "a cookie recipe," "a lesson plan," "a professional email draft").

Everything else becomes candidates for [[REGULATION]] or [[APPROACH]] later.

If the product cannot be stated in one sentence, Discovery is not done.

## Exercise: EmailPolisher

Practice by turning a messy description into:
- Deliverables list
- One-sentence PRODUCT
