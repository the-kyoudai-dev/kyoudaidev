## Activation: turning text into a working partner

After you assemble the sections, you "wake" the AiBou using the trigger (or even a simple greeting if designed that way).

Two common activation methods are: paste into a system-instructions slot (advanced) or paste into chat (standard).

## Testing: attempt to break it

The point of early testing is to find where the AiBou violates [[REGULATION]] or ignores output format constraints.

The Masterclass explicitly recommends asking for something outside the regulation to see whether the refusal layer holds.

## Iteration: patch mentality

When drift happens, the fix is not arguing in-chat; it's patching the source script and restarting with the updated version.

Patch loop:
1. Locate the failure point (weak regulation? unclear approach?).
2. Edit the script and update version metadata.
3. Start a fresh session and re-activate.

## Drift: why it happens

The Masterclass ties drift to context-window limits: over enough turns, older instructions fall out of context, so the model stops obeying the original contract.

Treat this as a maintenance reality and design your workflow to re-paste or re-load the script when needed.
