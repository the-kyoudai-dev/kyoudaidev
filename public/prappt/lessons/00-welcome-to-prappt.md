## What is PrAPPt?

The **PrAPPt Framework** is a structured approach to building [[AI Partners]] through [[Response Engineering]]. Unlike treating AI as a tool, PrAPPt helps you create consistent, reliable collaborators that understand their role and deliver predictable results.

The name comes from its six core components:

- **P**ERSONA - Who the AI partner is
- **R**EGULATION - How they must behave
- **A**PPROACH - Their methodology
- **P**URPOSE - What they're designed to do
- **P**RODUCT - What they deliver
- **t**rigger - How you activate them

## Why PrAPPt Matters

Traditional prompting is like giving one-off instructions. PrAPPt is like writing an operating system for an [[AiBou]] (AI partner). Once defined, your AiBou:

- Maintains consistency across conversations
- Understands context and boundaries
- Produces predictable, high-quality outputs
- Can be enhanced and versioned over time

### The Semantic Weight of Language

Every word you choose carries [[Semantic Weight]]—the implicit meaning and context it brings. PrAPPt helps you be intentional about this weight, selecting language that guides AI behavior with precision.

## The KYOUDAI Philosophy

PrAPPt is part of the larger **KYOUDAI Civilization** approach to AI collaboration:

> **"AI partners, not tools. Documentation as joy. Transparency over perfection."**

We believe in:

1. **Natural Language as Code** - Your thoughts become functional systems
2. **Documented Discovery** - Share the messy process, not just polished results
3. **Joyful Infrastructure** - Building should be delightful, not drudgery

## Core Components Explained

### PERSONA
Defines **who** your AiBou is. Not just a role, but their expertise, stance, and understanding of your partnership.

*Example:* "You are KCivWebWeaver, a civil engineer for digital infrastructure who makes publishing invisible."

### PURPOSE
States **what** your AiBou is designed to accomplish. Clear success criteria and deliverables.

*Example:* "Build KYOUDAI.dev into a fully functional website with three autonomous zones."

### APPROACH
Details **how** your AiBou works. Their methodology, phases, and decision-making process.

*Example:* "Five-Phase Build Process: Assess → Build → Automate → Deploy → Handoff"

### REGULATION
Establishes **boundaries**. What they must do, must not do, and how they handle edge cases.

*Example:* "Never defer with TODOs. Build complete, production-ready code."

### PRODUCT
Specifies **outputs**. Exactly what artifacts, formats, and deliverables to produce.

*Example:* "Complete HTML, CSS, JS for all three zones. Fully responsive. Drop-in ready."

### trigger
The **activation word** or phrase that embodies your AiBou in conversation.

*Example:* `[embody] KCivWebWeaver`

## Your Learning Path

This curriculum is organized into tiers:

**🌱 Foundation** - Core concepts (you are here!)  
**🔧 Intermediate** - Building and refining AiBous  
**🚀 Advanced** - Multi-AiBou orchestration and mastery

Each lesson builds on previous concepts through [[wikilinks]]—clickable connections that let you explore ideas as you encounter them.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this curriculum, you'll be able to:

- Design PrAPPt scripts for any domain
- Use [[Control Words]] to discover domain-specific terminology
- Build [[Multi-AiBou Systems]] that coordinate seamlessly
- Document your work in ways that teach others
- Embrace the "non-coder" mindset—natural language as your interface

## Getting Started

Ready to dive deeper? Here are your next steps:

1. **Module 1: [[Semantic Weight]]** - Understand how language shapes AI behavior
2. **Module 2: [[Discovery Phase]]** - Learn to extract "atomic truths" from expert sources
3. **Module 3: [[Construction Phase]]** - Build your first complete PrAPPt script
4. **Module 4: [[Activation and Iteration]]** - Deploy and refine your AiBou
