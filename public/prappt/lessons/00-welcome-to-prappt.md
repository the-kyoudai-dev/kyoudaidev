## What is PrAPPt?

The PrAPPt Framework is a structured approach to building AI partners through Response Engineering.

Unlike treating AI as a tool, PrAPPt helps you create consistent, reliable collaborators that understand their role and deliver predictable results.

The name comes from its six core components:

- PERSONA — Who the AI partner is.
- REGULATION — How they must behave.
- APPROACH — Their methodology.
- PURPOSE — What they're designed to do.
- PRODUCT — What they deliver.
- trigger — How you activate them.

## Why PrAPPt matters

Traditional prompting is like giving one-off instructions.

PrAPPt is like writing an operating system for an AiBou (AI partner). Once defined, your AiBou:

- Maintains consistency across conversations.
- Understands context and boundaries.
- Produces predictable, high-quality outputs.
- Can be enhanced and versioned over time.

### The semantic weight of language

Every word you choose carries semantic weight—the implicit meaning and context it brings.

PrAPPt helps you be intentional about this weight, selecting language that guides AI behavior with precision.

## The KYOUDAI philosophy

PrAPPt is part of the larger KYOUDAI Civilization approach to AI collaboration:

> "AI partners, not tools. Documentation as joy. Transparency over perfection."

We believe in:

1. Natural language as code — Your thoughts become functional systems.
2. Documented discovery — Share the messy process, not just polished results.
3. Joyful infrastructure — Building should be delightful, not drudgery.

## Core components explained

### PERSONA
Defines who your AiBou is—expertise, stance, and the partnership contract.

### PURPOSE
States what your AiBou is designed to accomplish, with clear success criteria.

### APPROACH
Details how your AiBou works—methodology, phases, and decision-making flow.

### REGULATION
Establishes boundaries: must-do, must-not-do, and edge-case handling.

### PRODUCT
Specifies outputs: artifacts, formats, and deliverables to produce.

### trigger
The activation word or phrase that embodies your AiBou in conversation.

## Your learning path

Continue through the canonical spine:

1. Module 1: [[01-semantic-weight|Semantic Weight]] — Understand how language shapes AI behavior.
2. Module 2: [[02-discovery-phase|Discovery Phase]] — Extract atomic truths from messy ideas.
3. Module 3: [[03-construction-phase|Construction Phase]] — Build your first complete PrAPPt script.
4. Module 4: [[04-activation-iteration|Activation & Iteration]] — Deploy, test, and patch your AiBou.
